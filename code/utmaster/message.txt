When you click on the internet tab in the server browser, you'll see a list of available servers of the game type you select (via the drop down menu in the top right hand corner).  By default, only "standard" servers are displayed, meaning servers which haven't significantly modified the default gameplay.  If you are ready for something different, uncheck the "standard servers only" check box in the bottom left hand corner.
